## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was able to combine what I learned about flex and grid to structure my desktop page. For this project I practiced using "nth-child" selectors to select my rating and review cards, and put used "align-self: center/flex-end" on those same cards to stager the cards across their container.

### Continued development

The site could still use work on the responsiveness, the desktop version doesn't look good when its too small in width or height. Plus it doesn't scroll.

### Useful resources

- [have two div blocks side by side, stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37421874/having-two-div-blocks-aligned-side-by-side-wordpress-website) - Helped me reduce my 5 star rating cards from 2 horizontal blocks to 1 inline block.
- [:nth-child, mozilla.org](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:nth-child) - Using :nth-child selectors I selected my cards to apply the staggering effect, as opposed to giveing each card a new class in the html. Ex .card-1, .card-2, .card-3
- [background images, w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_backgrounds.asp) - This w3schools page helped me add the light grey backgrounds on the body.
